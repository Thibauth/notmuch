 *     Note that the addition of a directory is not interesting here,
 *     since that will have been taken care of in pass 1. Also, we
 *     don't immediately act on file/directory removal since we must
 *     ensure that in the case of a rename that the new filename is
 *     added before the old filename is removed, (so that no
 *     information is lost from the database).
